## Phase 2: Hybrid Search Implementation (Qdrant & Ollama)

### Backend Development (Hybrid Search)
- [ ] Implement API endpoint for hybrid search (Solr + Qdrant).
- [ ] Develop logic for optional LLM-based query expansion (Ollama).
- [ ] Implement parallel querying to Solr and Qdrant.
- [ ] Create logic for merging and ranking results from Solr and Qdrant.
- [ ] Develop API endpoint for optional RAG-based answer generation (Ollama).

### Data Pipeline (Qdrant)
- [ ] Develop scripts/processes to generate vector embeddings for legal documents.
  - [ ] Choose an appropriate embedding model (e.g., Sentence-Transformers for German).
    - [x] **Selected Model**: `qllama/multilingual-e5-large-instruct:latest` via local Ollama instance.
    - [ ] **Ollama Endpoint**: `http://ollama:11434` (within Docker network)
  - [ ] Create a Python script (e.g., `docker/qdrant/qdrant_indexer.py` or in a new `docker/qdrant/` directory).
    - [ ] Script should fetch documents (from Solr or original sources like XML).
    - [ ] Script should extract relevant text for embedding.
    - [ ] Script should generate embeddings using the chosen model via Ollama endpoint.
- [ ] Implement indexing of embeddings into Qdrant.
  - [ ] Script should connect to the Qdrant service.
    - [ ] **Qdrant Endpoint**: `http://qdrant:6333` (within Docker network)
  - [ ] Script should define and create a Qdrant collection if it doesn't exist (specify vector size, distance metric).
  - [ ] Script should store embeddings along with a payload (e.g., document ID, title) in Qdrant.

### Frontend Development (Hybrid Search)
- [ ] Adapt UI to display combined/RAG results if necessary.
- [ ] Integrate new API endpoints for hybrid search and RAG.

- [x] **Schema Analysis**: German legal document fields identified:
  - `kurzue`, `langue`, `text_content`: `text_de` (German text analysis)
  - `amtabk`, `jurabk`: `string` (exact strings)
- [x] **Schema Service Extended** (`schemaService.js`):
  - `analyzeSchemaForUI()` recognizes `text_de` and `text_de_exact` field types
  - `getDisplayFields()` prioritizes German legal document fields
  - `getContextualFacets()` uses German fields in an explicit OR query
- [x] **Solr Service Adjusted** (`solrService.js`):
  - Explicit OR query for combined text and string field search
  - Text fields: `kurzue:(${query}) OR langue:(${query}) OR text_content:(${query})`
  - String fields: `amtabk:"${query}" OR jurabk:"${query}"`
  - Highlighting fields extended with German fields
- [x] **URL Encoding Problems Fixed**: 400 Bad Request error fixed by correct `encodeURIComponent()` usage
- [x] **Query Syntax Optimized**: From DisMax/eDisMax to explicit OR query for better string field control
- [x] **Successful Search**: Search for "BImSchV" and other German legal terms works completely
- [x] **Field-Specific Wildcard Support**: String fields (`amtabk`, `jurabk`) use wildcard matching

**Result**: German legal document search fully functional with correct field prioritization and wildcard support

### 7.5 German Legal Document Abbreviations Fix (‚úÖ FULLY COMPLETED - Jan 12, 2025)
- [x] **Problem Identified**: Complete German legal abbreviations like "1. BImSchV" yielded no search results
- [x] **Filter Problem Diagnosed**: Filters only worked in "All Fields" mode, not in field-specific searches
- [x] **Root Cause Analysis**: Wildcard queries with spaces (`amtabk:*1. BImSchV*`) fail in Solr string fields
- [x] **Solr Query Tests**: Validation of different query patterns:
  - `amtabk:"1. BImSchV"` (exact) ‚úÖ
  - `amtabk:*BImSchV*` (simple) ‚úÖ
  - `amtabk:*1.*` (simple) ‚úÖ
  - `amtabk:*1. BImSchV*` (with space) ‚ùå
  - `amtabk:*1.* AND amtabk:*BImSchV*` (compound AND) ‚úÖ
- [x] **Helper Function Implemented**: `buildGermanLegalQuery()` in both services:
  - Automatically detects spaces in queries
  - Splits queries with spaces into compound AND patterns
  - Supports both exact matches and wildcard variants
- [x] **SolrService Updated**:
  - Field-specific searches for `amtabk` and `jurabk` use compound queries
  - General search uses helper function for German legal fields
  - Combines exact and wildcard approaches: `exact OR wildcard`
- [x] **SchemaService Updated**:
  - Same helper function implemented for consistency
  - `getContextualFacets()` uses helper function for German legal fields
- [x] **UI Tests Successful**: Web interface shows correct search results for "1. BImSchV"
- [x] **Filter Functionality Validated**: Filters work correctly in field-specific modes

**Query Pattern Solution**: `amtabk:*1.* AND amtabk:*BImSchV*` for queries with spaces
**Result**: German legal abbreviations with spaces work completely in all search modes

## 13. Code Quality & Refactoring (Added on 2025-06-09)

### 13.1 Frontend Modularization (‚úÖ FULLY COMPLETED - 2025-06-09)
- **Goal**: Improve code structure, readability, and maintainability through modularization.
- [x] **DocumentExport.jsx Refactoring**:
    - [x] HTML export logic extracted to `src/lib/htmlExporter.js`.
    - [x] PDF export logic extracted to `src/lib/pdfExporter.js`.
    - [x] Related text formatting and file utilities moved to `src/utils/textFormatters.jsx` and `src/utils/fileUtils.js`.
- [x] **DynamicResultsDisplay.jsx Refactoring**:
    - [x] `ResultItem.jsx` component created for individual search results.
    - [x] Text utilities (`highlightSearchTerms`, `truncateText`) moved to `src/utils/textFormatters.jsx`.
- [x] **DocumentFullView.jsx Refactoring**:
    - [x] Text formatting helpers (`getContentForDisplay`, `formatLegalTextAsFallback`) moved to `src/utils/textFormatters.jsx`.
- [x] **Centralization of Utility Functions**:
    - [x] `src/utils/queryUtils.js` created for `buildGermanLegalQuery`.
    - [x] `src/utils/documentUtils.js` for document-specific helpers (from `uiHelpers`).
    - [x] `src/utils/formatUtils.js` for `formatFieldValue` (from `uiHelpers`).
    - [x] `uiHelpers` in `src/config/uiConfig.js` cleaned up.
- [x] **Service Clarification**:
    - [x] Comments added in `schemaService.js` to clarify the division of roles vs. `uiConfig.js`.
- [x] **Build Fix**:
    - [x] `textFormatters.js` renamed to `textFormatters.jsx` and imports corrected to fix build errors.
- **Result**: Significantly improved code organization, reduction of duplicates, and clearer module responsibilities.

### 13.2 Bugfixes and Robustness (‚úÖ FULLY COMPLETED - 2025-06-10)
- **Goal**: Improve application stability and fix critical bugs.
- [x] **TableOfContents Bugfix**:
    - [x] Problem identified: Table of contents disappeared when opening the full-text view with TypeError "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')".
    - [x] Cause diagnosed: Mix of ES Module imports and CommonJS require in documentService.js.
    - [x] Solution implemented:
        - [x] New documentService.js created with consistent ES module syntax.
        - [x] Import of isFrameworkDocument corrected (from require to import).
        - [x] Defensive programming with null checks and default values added in TableOfContents.jsx.
    - [x] Tests performed: Full functionality of the table of contents confirmed.
- **Result**: Full-text view now works stably with a correctly displayed table of contents.


### 13.3 Project Cleanup & Hybrid Search Restoration (‚úÖ FULLY COMPLETED - 2025-06-11)
- **Goal**: Remove obsolete files, unify Docker configuration, and restore Hybrid Search.
- [x] **File Cleanup**:
    - [x] 27 empty/obsolete files removed (shell scripts, Docker files, Python scripts).
    - [x] Obsolete directories (`/api`, `/docker`, `/src`) removed.
- [x] **Docker Configuration**:
    - [x] `docker-compose-hybrid.yml` renamed to `docker-compose.yml` as standard.
    - [x] Frontend container rebuild to fix the 500 Internal Server Error.
- [x] **API Restoration**:
    - [x] POST `/api/hybrid/search` route added in `backend/api/routes/hybrid.js`.
    - [x] Path corrections in Python scripts (`/search-engines/` -> `/app/scripts/qdrant/`).
    - [x] Nginx proxy configuration for `/api/` route implemented.
- [x] **System Verification**:
    - [x] All 6 services (Frontend, API, Solr, Qdrant, Ollama, OpenWebUI) successfully tested.
    - [x] Hybrid Search validated via GET (frontend) and POST (API).
    - [x] Web interface on `http://localhost:8080` successfully connected.
- **Result**: A clean, lean repository with a single, working Docker configuration and fully restored hybrid search functionality.
